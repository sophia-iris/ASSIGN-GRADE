# ASSIGN-GRADE

I used thonny, a Phyton IDE. 

## How It Works 
- This programs allows you to assign a letter grade based on the score entered.
- The function called assigned_grade(score) will take a score as an input.
- if-elif-else statements are to assign the grade:  A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), and F (below 60).
- If score is less than 0 or greater than 100 the function should print a message like "Invalid score! Please enter a value between 0 and 100."

## How to Run the program
- Open Thonny.
- Run the file using the ASSIGN-GRADE code.
